# Asteroids

Asteroids is my second [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

## Background Image

The game includes the ability for a custom background image. The file `background.jpg` should be placed in the same directory as the main script.

1. Place the `background.jpg` file with your own image
2. Make sure to keep the filename the same, or update the filename in the `main.py` file
3. For best results, use an image that matches the game's resolution (1280x720)
